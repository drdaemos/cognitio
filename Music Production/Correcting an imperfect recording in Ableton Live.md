Before you start editing a record, make sure you perform it in the best way possible first. Editing of an audio clip might introduce unwanted distortion or change tonal quality, and if this is not something you want - do this before capturing your performance:

- If you are performing an instrument or singing - rehearse the part extensively together with the rest of the composition;
- Set up your input gain level to maximize the signal while avoiding clipping (going over 0 dBFS);
- Choose a correct musical meter and tempo in your DAW;
- Turn on the metronome or the rhythm track and listen to it while performing.

To edit an audio clip you want to correct - open it in the DAW (e.g. import and double-click on it in Ableton). You should see a waveform on top of a colored grid (displaying the beats based on the project tempo). Here is the example of an imperfect audio recording of a guitar performance:

When zoomed in, it will be noticeable that the strums (moments of largest amplitude) are not aligned with the beat divisions. These moments are generally called as "transients", are defined as this:

>A transient is the initial peak of a soundâ€”the first spikes in the waveform, as it were.

Ableton Live will attempt to automatically detect these transients and indicate them as small gray triangles (shown below). On the screenshot below you can observe a misaligned transient - it should have been closer to the "1.2" marker on the clip timeline.

You can manipulate clip timing by adding and dragging Warp Markers in Ableton Live and this is done non-destructively (which means you can always remove warping or change it without affecting the original audio). You might also want to check different Warp modes in the clip settings (make sure that the "Warp" option is on) and pick the best one based on the kind of sound you're editing (see more here: https://www.ableton.com/en/live-manual/12/audio-clips-tempo-and-warping/#warp-modes).

Add a Warp Marker (showed as yellow symbols right on top of the waveform) by double-clicking on the transient or any other position in the clip and drag it to the correct position. Audio between the Warp Markers will be automatically adjusted to match the timing. Usually when correcting an audio clip timing you want to add markers on transients (gray arrows on initial peaks) and align them with the correct beat division. 

The screenshot below shows the clip with the corrected timing:
