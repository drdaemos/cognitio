To create a flam note in Step Sequencer, you should enable a note right before the needed beat and edit the step rates for the 4 notes before the beat, so they sum up like this:

```
8D + /64 + /32 + /64
```

The last note is the flam before the next beat. Optionally, you can also offset this note to +50% or something like that.
