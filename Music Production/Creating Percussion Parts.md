Percussion parts in music mostly serve to fulfill the **Rhythmic** function in a music composition. Percussion is not the only thing that does this—other instruments like guitar or bass may also participate in that process, however, drums are the most critical component that creates a sense of pulsation, flow and makes our heads bopping—in other words, it adds a **groove**.

## Common layers in a groove

It all starts with a **Beat**, which helps our brain to feel the pulse of music. The Beat is usually played on a kick drum and is commonly laid down on the on-beats (1 and 3) in a typical 4/4 time signature (schematic depicts 1 bar in 4/4 divided by 16th notes):

```
      1    2    3    4   
Kick |O---⁞----⁞O---⁞----|
```

The Beat is usually juxtaposed against another layer, commonly played on a snare drum or by clapping — I will call this layer a **Snap** and in a typical backbeat it is played on the off-beats (2 and 4). Usually it is a higher pitched, transient (snappy) sound compared to the Beat. Snap works together with the Beat to create a foundation for the groove (marked by `x` on the chart):

```
       1    2    3    4
Snare |----⁞x---⁞----⁞x---|
Kick  |O---⁞----⁞O---⁞----|
```

The final stroke to complete a basic groove is adding some **Constant** layer on top of Beat and Snap. While the former two are usually stable and focused on staying in tempo, the **Constant** adds a feeling of movement and helps us to sense smaller sub-divisions (like 8th or 16th notes) and the swing feel of the rhythm. 

It also adds an even higher pitched sound to the picture and fills other frequencies, adding to a "fuller" sound of the music composition. On a drum kit this layer is usually played by cymbals (hi-hat, ride, crash) and here it is depicted on each 8th note of the bar.

```
        1    2    3    4
Hi-hat |x-x-⁞x-x-⁞x-x-⁞x-x-|
Snare  |----⁞x---⁞----⁞x---|
Kick   |O---⁞----⁞O---⁞----|
```

There is no rule that a groove should always have all three layers at once or that you can do a, let's say, **Beat** layer only with a low-pitch drum like a kick. Many contemporary songs do follow the aforementioned framework, but some of them also break it at times and become memorable and less boring.
