Music is often perceived in 3D space and the quality of a mix is mostly about how different parts and instruments fill this space. There is no universally "correct" way to mix a song, but we can develop certain principles that help to avoid problems in a mix - and if our mix stays in the expected ballpark range for a genre, it is likely to be perceived as good.

The three dimensions we can use in the mix are:
- Proximity
	- how close or far away something is from the listener
	- what is on the foreground and what is in the background
	- where the focus is
- Horizontal position (stereo width)
	- if something is to the left or to the right
- Vertical position
	- if something is higher or lower
	- side-effect: we can discern higher-pitched sounds better than lower-pitched sounds
		- e.g. 10 high pitch bells are easy to separate in the space compared to 3 bass guitars

## Proximity

Proximity is mostly affected by volume, but also by distorting the sound (the more distorted it, the more close we feel it).

## Horizontal position

Is affected by short time delay effects (<30ms) - reverbs, choruses, flangers etc. Having such delay makes it harder to understand the position of the sound, making it appear everywhere at once.

# Kinds of mixes

- Sparse vs dense
- Static vs moving

# Problems of mixes

Muddiness

EQ disbalance
