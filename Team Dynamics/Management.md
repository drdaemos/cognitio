git**Management** describes a relationship where someone else is taking actions but it is you who bears responsibility for the end result (at least, to some extent). You have to be able to impact the process of achieving the result for management practices to be effective.

Goal of a manager is to gather people and establish circumstances so these people are capable of achieving the expected result under reasonable constraints (most common are *time* and *budget*, but there are others).
## Degrees of Uncertainty

- We are managing the way to achieve something through planning certain activities and having people to address them
- There are different levels of uncertainty within things that can be addressed
- When certain activity has a clear expected result, but there is some freedom of how it is achieved - we refer to it as **Task**
- When the end result is also unclear, we call it a **Problem**
- Because Problems have a high degree of uncertainty within them, it is hard to objectively control solving them
	- Therefore Managers have to get the right Specialists to solve problems and have to establish **Trust** with them
	- Trust is needed so Specialists can develop the best possible way of understanding and solving the problem
	- Solving the problem is, unfortunately, is not granted and there might not be the way to prove before actually investing time and effort
- Thus, when you are dealing with more uncertainty, it is reasonable to focus on establishing the Trust.
	- I personally believe that software development is mostly about dealing with unknown things (mostly, because the end result, the feasibility of reaching it, the constraints are all unclear, especially at the start of the project).
## Trust vs Control

- **Trust** is a belief that the object of trust won't hurt you (do some actions to impair your activities). 
- At the same time, **Control** is the way to ensure that the object behaves like expected.
- These two concepts are tightly coupled and affect each other. Trust implies that there is a certain lack of Control (because otherwise it is not longer a belief).
- Instead of enacting Control, you can increase Trust through regular communication and feedback loops and by making the whole relationship and outputs more transparent for both parties
- Another extreme is Micromanagement. It strips the Executor from a freedom of deciding for both end result and a way to achieve it. Micromanagement sows **distrust** and adds **waste** to the process (because you have to spend effort to control the process).
- Under micromanagement, there is the highest risk that another party is not honest with you and your mutual intentions are not aligned - therefore it increases the risk of jeopardizing problem solving\

## Indicators vs Trust

- We can perform Control by observing things that are connected with the outcomes or the process. Usually we take evaluations or measurements of such a thing over time and compare them to other measurements.
- Thing under observation is called an **indicator** when there is a clearly defined way of calculating it.
- **Metric** is something that is built upon an **indicator** and has allows us to understand the relation between two different measures or between two different indicators - puts it in the perspective.
	- Thus it allows to judge if something is closer or further from what we expect.
- Metric is always an oversimplification of the actual process and it's result, because it focuses on much less data points that are potentially available and because the systems are usually much more complicated than we imagine
	- We try to find a correlation between the desired result and the metric
	- Most people also have a belief that improving a metric value will help to reach the desired result 
- A lot of metrics and indicators are a proxy to the actual expected result because it is non-feasible or impossible to measure what we are actually interested in.
	- e.g. **Cycle Time** is a proxy metric because the desired result of the team activity is a solved problem, and not a certain speed of processing the action items within the project

### Implications on team dynamics and trust

- When metrics deal with a team's outputs or outcomes, they inevitably affect our judgement regarding the status quo: "is it good or bad now?"
- A judgement based on the feedback loop may start to contradict a judgement based on the metrics
- Because often there are only proxy metrics available, there is a room for interpretation on the reasons of the metric movement - and there is a room of conflict of opinions of the manager and the team
- This conflict creates a **distrustful** environment
- Also, it motivates the team to try to influence the metric values (because no one wants to look bad) instead of achieving the goal
	- It is usually simpler to distort the measurements or the system itself rather than to improve the system 
		- see Deming's thoughts on the topic: https://deming.org/distorting-the-system-distorting-the-data-or-improving-the-system/
- Conflict can be avoided if the team itself is trusted to select metrics for themselves and is interested in using them to accomplish the goal
	- e.g. a DevOps team may track the **Four Golden Signals** for the services they manage
	- this can be used as an effective measure of whether they succeed in maintaining the service availability
- Often it is more practical to measure technical systems rather than systems of people
	- Technical systems don't lose trust when being measured
	- It is easier to gather objective quantified metrics for a technical system performance

## Manager's focus

- Activities are commonly classified as either *tactical* (these are focused at solving a specific case) or *strategic* (solving a class of problems, leveraging and multiplying team's efficiency)
- If manager is focused on solving tactical problems, they might be taking their teammates opportunities to be under the spotlight and display their specialized skills
- It is also hard to delegate strategical activities to the team because usually specialists lack required skills or higher-level awareness to solve problems with organizational processes or cross-team collaboration
	- Some strategical activities can be facilitated by the manager and solved within a group
- Therefore managers should prioritize doing strategical activities instead of tactical
	- As an exception, managers might occasionally perform tactical activities to gain deeper understanding of the process and it's bottleneck, or to get a better grasp of the problem domain
## Quality

- Профессиональная этика помогает обеспечить качество решения и позволяет гордиться результатом.
- Нужна энергия, чтобы использовать этику и отстаивать свои решения.
