This section is the entrypoint to my exploration of music and how it works—mainly done to be able to write it better and with greater consciousness.
## Core Principles

Most genres of music aim to keep listener engaged with it and achieve that through evoking a sense of movement and progression, creating a feeling that something changes and transforms when you listen to a music piece—and these changes represent a story progression or a mood change or a struggle of internal feelings.

Music is perceived temporally: we don't "see" the whole song at once but listen to it for some period of time. Is also perceived in multiple layers at once: we hear multiple different timbres and instruments together and some combinations sound pleasantly while others make us tense. 

Within a musical composition we can recognize the following themes and patterns:

- Moments of [Tension and release](Composition%20Notions/Tension%20and%20release.md)
- [Foreground and background](Composition%20Notions/Foreground%20and%20background.md)
- [Call and response](Composition%20Notions/Call%20and%20response.md) within phrases
- Motives, [Familiar vs unexpected](Composition%20Notions/Familiar%20vs%20unexpected.md) parts
- [Energy and Rhythms](Composition%20Notions/Energy%20and%20Rhythms.md)
- [Sound dynamics and Articulation](Composition%20Notions/Sound%20dynamics%20and%20Articulation.md) of certain moments

## Parts of a Composition

### Rhythm

Rhythm creates a sensation of pulse, relevance to time measure and perception of energy level. It may be carried by any musical instruments or song parts—drums, bass, synths, guitars.
### Melody

It is something we remember and can hum or sing to—a foreground of a song, its' story.
### Harmony

Harmony serves to create a feeling of circumstances around the melody, a background, a mood. It is created by different pitches coinciding with one another (e.g. by chords or different instruments playing at the same time).

Temporally creates a sense of movement through [Chord Progressions](Harmony/Chord%20Progressions.md)

## Musical Language

Music is built from the following blocks:

- [Notes (Pitch classes)](Musical%20Language/Notes%20(Pitch%20classes).md)
- [Scales](Musical%20Language/Scales.md)
- [Intervals](Musical%20Language/Intervals.md)
- [Chords](Musical%20Language/Chords.md)

## Physics of Music

Physically speaking, all sounds that we hear are vibrations in the air, dividable into the basic elements: intensity and time. With some simplification, every sound wave can be decomposed into several smaller sine waves (by applying a Fourier Transform).

Music is a combination of different sounds and we can manipulate the properties of the sound waves to achieve musical goals—create different layers, articulate some moments, establish dynamics.

With physical instruments (like piano, guitar, drums etc.) we are limited by the mechanical design of an instrument. A guitar doesn't sound like a flute because of differences in how sound wave is produced. However, we still can produce different sounds by applying a different playing technique or smashing the strings harder or introducing pauses into our playing.

Understanding the physics of music is much more relevant when we replace physical instruments with sound synthesis. A lot of sounds in a modern electronic music are created with synthesizers—wave generators that allow to modify various properties of basic wave forms: sine, triangle, square and mix them with each other.

A sound is generally characterized by the following properties:

- [Pitch](Physics%20of%20Music/Pitch.md)
- [Volume](Physics%20of%20Music/Volume.md)
- [Timbre](Physics%20of%20Music/Timbre.md)
- [Duration](Physics%20of%20Music/Duration.md)
