This section is the entrypoint to my exploration of music and how it works—mainly done to be able to write it better and with greater consciousness.
## Core Principles

Most genres of music aim to keep listener engaged with it and achieve that through evoking a sense of movement and progression, creating a feeling that something changes and transforms when you listen to a music piece—and these changes represent a story progression or a mood change or a struggle of internal feelings.

Music is perceived temporally (we don't "see" the whole song at once but hear through it) but also in multiple layers at once (we hear multiple different timbres and instruments at once and some combinations sound pleasantly). 

Within a musical composition, we can recognize the following themes and patterns:

- Moments of [Tension and release](Tension%20and%20release.md)
- [Foreground and background](Foreground%20and%20background.md)
- [Call and response](Call%20and%20response.md) within phrases
- Motives, [Familiar vs unexpected](Familiar%20vs%20unexpected.md) parts
- [Energy and Rhythms](Energy%20and%20Rhythms.md)
- [Sound dynamics and Articulation](Sound%20dynamics%20and%20Articulation.md) of certain moments

## Parts of a Composition

### Rhythm

Rhythm creates a sensation of pulse, relevance to time measure and perception of energy level. It may be carried by any musical instruments or song parts—drums, bass, synths, guitars.
### Melody

It is something we remember and can hum or sing to—a foreground of a song, its' story.
### Harmony

Harmony serves to create a feeling of circumstances around the melody, a background, a mood. It is created by different pitches coinciding with one another (e.g. by chords or different instruments playing at the same time).

Temporally creates a sense of movement through [[Chord Progressions]]
