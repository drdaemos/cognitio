Music interval is a measure of pitch difference between two different notes. Most commonly, intervals are recognized between notes of a diatonic [scale](Scales.md) and within a distance of 1 octave. The smallest recognized interval is *semitone* (or a *minor second*):

| Interval           | Scale steps range | Distance (in semitones) | Alternative name        |
| ------------------ | ----------------- | :---------------------: | ----------------------- |
| Perfect **unison** | 1 steps           |            0            |                         |
| Minor **second**   | 2 steps           |            1            | semitone (S)            |
| Major **second**   | 2 steps           |            2            | whole tone (T)          |
| Minor **third**    | 3 steps           |            3            |                         |
| Major **third**    | 3 steps           |            4            |                         |
| Perfect **fourth** | 4 steps           |            5            |                         |
| **Tritone**        | 4.5 steps         |            6            | Aug. fourth, dim. fifth |
| Perfect **fifth**  | 5 steps           |            7            |                         |
| Minor **sixth**    | 6 steps           |            8            |                         |
| Major **sixth**    | 6 steps           |            9            |                         |
| Minor **seventh**  | 7 steps           |           10            |                         |
| Major **seventh**  | 7 steps           |           11            |                         |
| Perfect **octave** | 8 steps           |           12            |                         |

Each major can be extended (**augmented**) by one semitone, e.g. when major third is augmented—it has 5 semitones (just like a fourth). Each minor interval can also be shrinked (**diminished**) by a semitone. Perfect intervals can be either augmented or diminished.

Augmented or diminished intervals are important because their range in scale steps stays the same, even if they sound like a different interval. This is useful in chord building, because [chords](Chords.md) are built by stacking thirds on top of each other—but not every chord strictly has only minor or major third. For example, a **diminished** chord is built with two minor thirds—creating a diminished fifth or a tritone between the root note and the fifth.
