Notes represent individual, distinct sounds of a particular instrument and allow us to record and pass music scores to other people. They exist within a [temperament](Equal%20Temperament.md) system and are tuned to certain pitches (however that tuning is relative to the system). Notes may have a different [pitch](../Physics%20of%20Music/Pitch.md), [duration](../Physics%20of%20Music/Duration.md), they might be played louder or quieter (and therefore be different in [volume](../Physics%20of%20Music/Volume.md)), or played with various techniques (e.g. open picked note vs palm-muted note on the guitar) - which alters the sound [timbre](../Physics%20of%20Music/Timbre.md).

Pitch perception is periodical—we think that two notes have a same quality when the frequency of one is a double of another. For example, if one note sounds at 220 Hz and another—at 440 Hz, we perceive them as notes of the same pitch class in comparison to a note at 396 Hz (of a different pitch class).

In Western music (within 12-tone Equal Temperament system), we recognize the following pitch classes:

| Letter notation | Solfege notation     |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| C               | do                   |
| C# / Db         | do-diese / re-bemol  |
| D               | re                   |
| D# / Eb         | re-diese / mi-bemol  |
| E               | mi                   |
| F               | fa                   |
| F# / Gb         | fa-diese / sol-bemol |
| G               | sol                  |
| G# / Ab         | sol-diese / la-bemol |
| A               | la                   |
| A# / Bb         | la-diese / si-bemol  |
| B (or H)        | si                   |
