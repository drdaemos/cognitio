Notes represent individual, distinct sounds of a particular instrument and allow us to record and pass music scores to other people. They exist within a [temperament](Equal%20Temperament.md) system and are tuned to certain pitches (however that tuning is relative to the system). Notes may have a different [pitch](../Physics%20of%20Music/Pitch.md), [duration](../Physics%20of%20Music/Duration.md), they might be played louder or quieter (and therefore be different in [volume](../Physics%20of%20Music/Volume.md)), or played with various techniques (e.g. open picked note vs palm-muted note on the guitar) - which alters the sound [timbre](../Physics%20of%20Music/Timbre.md).
## Pitch classes

Pitch perception is periodical—we think that two notes have the same quality when the frequency of one is a double of another. For example, if one note sounds at 220 Hz and another—at 440 Hz, we perceive them as notes of the same class in comparison to a note at 396 Hz (of a different pitch class). This concept is called "octave equivalence".

In Western music (within 12-tone Equal Temperament system), we recognize the following pitch classes:

| Letter notation | Solfege notation     |
| --------------- | -------------------- |
| C               | do                   |
| C# / Db         | do-diese / re-bemol  |
| D               | re                   |
| D# / Eb         | re-diese / mi-bemol  |
| E               | mi                   |
| F               | fa                   |
| F# / Gb         | fa-diese / sol-bemol |
| G               | sol                  |
| G# / Ab         | sol-diese / la-bemol |
| A               | la                   |
| A# / Bb         | la-diese / si-bemol  |
| B (or H)        | si                   |

These pitch classes are ordered and go in cycles—after each note B (of some octave) there is note C (of the next octave), e.g. after note B3 goes note C4. 

The distance between each two notes of the list is exactly 1 [semitone](Intervals.md), or 1/12 of the octave.
## Duration

Note durations are relative to the musical [meter](Meter.md) and [[tempo]]. For instance, a *whole* note sounds for the entire duration of 1 bar (measure). Shorter notes are called *subdivisions*:

| Name          | Duration | Symbol |
| ------------- | -------- | ------ |
| whole         | 1 bar    | 𝅝     |
| half          | ½ bar    | 𝅗𝅥     |
| quarter       | ¼ bar    | 𝅘𝅥     |
| eighth        | ⅛ bar    | 𝅘𝅥𝅮     |
| sixteenth     | ¹⁄₁₆ bar | 𝅘𝅥𝅯     |
| thirty-second | ¹⁄₃₂ bar | 𝅘𝅥𝅰     |

Notes can be also extended by half of their original duration by adding a dot after them. For example, a dotted eighth note 𝅘𝅥𝅮. should sound for ¹⁄₁₂ bar. 

Groups of notes can organized into various tuplets—irregular equal subdivisions within 1 beat. For example, *triplets* are groupings of three equal notes, each sounding for ⅓ duration of a triplet. In such grouping three eighth triplet notes will sound as long as one quarter note (instead of just two eighth notes).

Also, the same subdivisions can be silent—then they are called *rests* and displayed with a different set of symbols.
