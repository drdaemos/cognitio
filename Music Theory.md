## Aspects of composition
### Rhythm
Rhythm creates a sensation of pulse, relevance to time measure and perception of energy level. It may be carried by any musical instruments or song parts—drums, bass, synths, guitars      
### Melody
It is something we remember and can hum or sing to—a foreground of a song, its' story
### Harmony
Harmony serves to create a feeling of circumstances around the melody, a background, a mood. It is created by different pitches coinciding with one another (e.g. by chords or different instruments playing at the same time).
Temporally creates a sense of movement through [[chord progressions]]
