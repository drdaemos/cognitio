## How to compose vocals over harmony?

**Problem**: 

when trying to come up with a good vocal melody, it is often hard to sound confidently and have meaningful purposeful lines. Instead, they sound like just going up and down the scale with a weak unsure tone.

**Solutions**:

- Sing random words
- Sing whole notes with no rhythm
	- This will work as a high-level direction, a melody contour
	- It should fit the harmony
	- Later it can be refined to include lead-in notes, grace notes and connections

- Take random song lyrics and just sing them over the harmony
	- Surprisingly, that works really well compared to just inventing a melody on the spot without any lyrics
