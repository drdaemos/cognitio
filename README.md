Hello there!

This is a repo containing my personal notes on various topics - including Software Engineering, Music Theory and others. These notes are incomplete (and might never ever become complete), sketchy and probably are hard-to-read because they are mostly written for me. 

I use [Obsidian app](https://obsidian.md/) to work on these notes and keep them synchronized.

## Topics Index

- [Music Theory](Music%20Theory/Music%20Theory.md)
