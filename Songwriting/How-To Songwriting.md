A very draft version.

A song is a form of musical composition that is focused around human singing. Usually, songs aim to captivate the listener and put them into a certain state of mind, evoke a particular feeling or tell them a story. 

Most songs have a some form of accompaniment (either instrumental or a cappella) and apply [Music Theory](../Music%20Theory/Music%20Theory.md) to create a fitting counterpart to song lyrics (words specifically written for a song).

You can start writing a song from various perspectivesâ€”there is no "correct" way to that. In most cases you either have with an idea (lyrical or musical) or you start exploring with some starters.

## Starting with an idea

Topics:
- A concept of lyrical hero (main persona)
- Understanding the message of a song (what's do you want to convey, how do you want listeners to feel)
- Show, don't tell (don't describe the message directly, describe what someone would do / notice if they were put to song circumstances, evoke emotion through allowing to connect listener's personal experiences with the song)
	- But don't overdo it, sometimes simple things should stay simple
- Understanding the lyrical dramathurgy (how the story is structured) and tying that to musical structure
- Common techniques to create connection between lyrics and music
	- Melody ups to intro a theme
	- Melody downs to put the sentence to end, get to the point
	- Prosody (reflecting emotional component via stressed syllables, word rhythm, accents)
		- Metrical feet and verse meter (iamb, choree, dactyl etc.)

## Starting with exploration

Topics:
- Mumbling / humming to harmony to create a melody
- Using lyric phrase templatse and building lines from that
	- template could be a list of words, loosely organized in the following order:
		- conjunction: `although`, `when`, `the more`, `for`, `but`, `and`, `if`, `why` (adverbs)
		- subject (who / what): `I`, `you`, `our`, `they`, `it`, `my`, `he`, `she`
		- verb (action / state of being): `see`, `care`, `know`, `want`, `think`, `feel`,  `play`
		- preposition (link, relationship between words): `since`, `below`, `to`, `within`, `over`
		- adjective (description): `my`, `his`, `charming`, `lovely`, `these`, `all`
		- object (who / what is targeted by the action): `eyes`, `house`, `song`, anything really
- Understanding melody
